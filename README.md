# MathTeachingTools
Just a repo with a bunch of random learning aids to help teach things to my friends

In order to use the convexExamples.py you need to install a dependency called [Manim](https://github.com/3b1b/manim)

Another convex set/function learning aid can be found on my desmos account [here](https://www.desmos.com/calculator/fktwsoacrt)
