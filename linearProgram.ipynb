    "We can sell each table for `$30` and each chair for `$45`. But both tables and chairs are made up of similar materials but both only require a certain amount of both materials to produce one of said product.\n",

    "say in order to make a table (x) it requires `22` wood and `15` steel per table\n",
    "and to make a chair (x2) it requires `45` wood and `10` steel per chair\n",
    "\n",
    "but we only have a certain amount of wood(`5500`) and steel(`2500`) avalible to make our products. So we must distribute the resources so we waste the least amount and make the most amount of money for the amount of material we have.\n",

(this is a topic for another time, I actually used this same example to show the dual for a class presentation) and then determine if the feasible bound on the dual changed. The same process could be said for adding a new constraint except we do not take the dual we just add a new row and then check to see if the problem is still feasible and if so did the feasible set change and if so we need to recompute."
